- **User Roles**: Configure user permissions and access levels
- **Emergency Types**: Add or modify emergency vehicle types

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

### Emergency Override
1. Navigate to the Emergency tab
2. Select the affected intersection
3. Click "Emergency Override" button
4. System automatically prioritizes the signal

### Manual Signal Control
1. Go to Traffic Signals tab
2. Select the target intersection
3. Click the desired signal state (Red/Yellow/Green)
4. Signal changes immediately

## 📱 Mobile Responsiveness

The system is fully responsive and optimized for:
- **Desktop**: Full feature access with multi-column layouts
